# Fake Viruses
This is a repository where I mess around with fake viruses. 
If you run any of the software on this repository and your pc/laptop crashes then that is your problem. 
Run this software at your own risk. 
I will not add any runable software you will have to build my software from source.
Which makes it harder for the average computer user can't accidentally run my software.
